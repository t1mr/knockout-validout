/*
* TODO: test the following
* 1) Validators behaviour when more than one is attached.
* 2) Validators order, can we break the validation by replacing the declaration order.
* 3) Revalidation in case of multiple validators (what happens if we fix one error but cause another one).
* 4) Can we find out scenario in which one validator overrides another validator error?
